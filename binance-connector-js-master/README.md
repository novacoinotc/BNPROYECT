Collection of auto-generated TypeScript connectors for Binance APIs.

## Migration Guide

If you're upgrading from the previous unified connector, refer to our [Migration Guide](./MIGRATION.md) for detailed steps on transitioning to the new modular structure. The legacy unified connectors (`@binance/connector` and `@binance/connector-typescript`) will still be available for a limited time. You can find the code for the unified connector in the `legacy` branch.

## Prerequisites

Before using the connectors, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** (version 22.12.0 or later)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **nvm** (Node Version Manager)

Using nvm:

```bash
nvm install 22.12.0
nvm use 22.12.0
```
